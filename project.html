            <p><B>Project 1: Gesture Controlled Audio System </B></p>
            <p> Users can interact with the system by bending the flex sensors to trigger
                specific audio responses. Each bending gesture corresponds to a unique audio file, enabling users to
                control the audio playback and generate different sounds based on their
                gestures.Users can also interact with the system through voice commands by
                producing loud sounds detected by the microphone.
                The system responds to loud sounds by playing predefined audio files,
                enhancing user engagement and interaction.The system provides auditory feedback through the speaker, confirming
                the successful detection and execution of user gestures and voice
                commands.
                 The audible responses help users understand and navigate the system,
                enhancing the overall userÂ experience.
                 </p>
                <p>SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION  </p>           
        <p>Initialization:
            <p>Upon powering on, the Arduino initializes the flex sensors, 
            microphone,MP3 module, and audio amplifier.
            The system performs a startup routine to ensure all components are
            functioning correctly.
             Sensor Input Detection:
            The Arduino continuously reads the analog values from the flex sensors
            and microphone.
            Based on the sensor readings, the Arduino identifies the type of gesture
            performed by the user (bending a flex sensor) or detects a loud sound
            from the microphone.
             Gesture Recognition:
             When a flex sensor detects a bending gesture (e.g., bending a specific
            finger), the Arduino triggers a corresponding audio file to play through the
            speaker via the MP3 module.
            Each flex sensor is associated with a unique audio file, allowing for
            distinct sound responses to different bending gestures.
            Voice Command Recognition:
             If the microphone detects a sound above the predefined threshold, the
            Arduino activates a specific audio file to play through the speaker,
            indicating a response to the detected loud sound.
            Audio Playback Control:
            The Arduino controls the playback of audio files on the MP3 module by
            sending serial commands to select and play the desired audio files.
            The audio amplifier amplifies the audio signal from the MP3 module,
            ensuring clear and audible sound output through the speaker.
            Volume Control:
            he system includes volume control functionality, allowing users to adjust
            the volume level of the audio output using predefined gestures or voice
            commands.
             The Arduino modifies the volume settings on the MP3 </p>
<p>HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<p>Hardware Components
    Flex Sensors:
    Ten flex sensors are connected to the analog input pins (A0 to A9) of the
    Arduino microcontroller.
    These sensors change their resistance based on the degree of bend,
    allowing them to detect and measure various bending gestures.
     Arduino Microcontroller:
    The Arduino serves as the central processing unit of the system, receiving
    input signals from the flex sensors and microphone, and controlling the
    audio playback through the MP3 module and audio amplifier.
     MP3-TF-16P MP3 SD Card Module:
    This module stores pre-recorded audio files corresponding to different
    gestures and loud sounds.
    The Arduino communicates with the MP3 module via a serial connection
    to trigger the playback of specific audio files based on the sensor inputs
    and microphone readings.
    PAM84403 Audio Amplifier:
    The audio amplifier is connected to the MP3 module and speaker to boost
    the audio signal, ensuring clear and audible sound output.
    Electret Microphone (MIC):
    The microphone detects loud sounds and sends an analog signal to the
    Arduino.
    When a sound above a predefined threshold is detected, the Arduino
    triggers a specific audio file to play through the speaker.

            <p><B>Project 2:Predictive Model for determining whether a person should be granted loan or not</B></p>
            <p>The significance is that our smart tool makes it easier for banks to decide who they should lend money to and 
                and who they should'nt.This not only protects the bank from losing money also ensures that people who afford money
                can afford to pay it back</p>
